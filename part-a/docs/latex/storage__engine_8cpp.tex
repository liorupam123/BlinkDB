\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of the LSM Tree based key-\/value storage engine. 

This file contains the implementation of the \doxylink{classStorageEngine}{Storage\+Engine} class, which provides a persistent key-\/value storage system using an LSM (Log-\/\+Structured Merge) Tree. The engine features\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item LRU caching for frequently accessed keys
\item In-\/memory Mem\+Table for recent writes
\item Disk-\/based SSTables organized in levels
\item Background compaction to maintain performance
\item Persistence via sorted disk files 
\end{DoxyItemize}
